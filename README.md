# Scrolling-Emails
Interactive email campaign with a scrolling minigame

These are simply files for recruiters and potential employers to view my work.
The emails were created in Marketo and some of the assets still link back to that location.

Style sheets cannot be loaded in most email clients. This means that all the styling information has to be within the HTML document.
Some particularly terrible emal browsers such as Outlook do not respect class information and require styling to be in-line. 

This results in a rudementary and intentionally disorganized file.
